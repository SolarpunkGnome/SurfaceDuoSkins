This is just a quick place to hold the files I used to make my H2G2 Surface Duo skin. If I do more skins I might make try to actually figure out how to do this GitHub thingy. Since Cricut seems to not want us to share project files, I'm just uploading the SVGs with links back to the original sources for now. I cut the thumb logo at 1.25" wide and the "Don't Panic" at 2.5" wide. They're layered directly on top of the v1.1 Surface Duo skin which is the same as lala's v1 but without the bounding box.

1) Hitchhiker thumb originally from (https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61cb87c118979013b4f7938b/62b20fea026b91dbc56619c9_Hitchikers%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy.svg). I removed the background so it would be easier to cut, but it might be better to use the original so you can have a box to trim the exterior material out of your sheet first. I manually added boxes around the "Don't Panic" and thumb before cutting.

2) "Don't Panic" text from Wikimedia (Make sure to "attach" before cutting or the Cricut software will "optimize" the letter placment): https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Don%27t_Panic.svg

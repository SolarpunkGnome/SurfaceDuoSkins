This is just a quick place to hold the files I used to make my H2G2 Surface Duo skin. If I do more skins I might make it a bit more formalized.

Since Cricut seems to not want us to share project files, I'm just uploading the SVGs with links back to the original sources for now.

1) Hitchhiker thumb (cut at 1.25" wide) originally from (https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61cb87c118979013b4f7938b/62b20fea026b91dbc56619c9_Hitchikers%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy.svg). I removed the background so it would be easier to cut, but it might be better to use the original so you can have a box to trim the exterior material out of your sheet first. I manually added boxes around the "Don't Panic" and thumb before cutting.

2) "Don't Panic" text from Wikimedia (Make sure to "attach" before cutting or the Cricut software will "optimize" the letter placment): https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Don%27t_Panic.svg
